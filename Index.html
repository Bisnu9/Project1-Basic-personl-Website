  <h1>Welcome to my website it's great to see you</h1>
 
  <p>Hi, my name is Bishwajit Pandey and I am from Arunachal Pradesh(Namsai). I'm currently a student who is studying about web development. I've been learning web development for 
    about more than a week and so far my journey of becoming a web developer seem to be going preety great although it is not that easy 
    as it seems to be.</p>

    <p>I've completed my high school with Commerce and my graduation in Art's and you could really tell
        that I'm struggling learning programming a little bit since this is a very new thing to me. But learning 
        something new really challenges me to get out of my comfort zone and do something that benefits me to develop my
        personal skills any my personality. 
    </p>
    <h2>But why programming?</h2>
    <p>Learning programming is not something my childhood dream but growing up I've always wondered how do we 
       see things in the screen what we want to see and it automatically changes to different channel as we want to, even though it is only a screen
       made up of glass. To me it was very fascinating.
    </p>
    <h2>So why didn't I study science or something related to technology?</h2>
    <p>I've lived my whole childhood in my village where people have no idea what programming is or anything related to technology.
        I did not have any privilege to learn about programming and be able to be in that enviroment where I can get any guidance.
        But stepping out of my village really helped me to not missed that opportunity of what I've always wondered about. Last but not least,
        I know the fact that it is not an easy thing to learn but all I know is that I will give my full effort to become a programmer.
